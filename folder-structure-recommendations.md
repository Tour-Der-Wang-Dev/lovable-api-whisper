# Folder Structure Recommendations

## Current Structure Analysis

The current project structure follows a relatively simple organization pattern:

```
/src
  /components
    /ui         - UI components from shadcn/ui
  /hooks        - Custom React hooks
  /lib          - Utility functions
  /pages        - Page components
```

This is a good starting point but could be enhanced for better scalability as the application grows.

## Recommended Improvements

### 1. Feature-Based Organization

As the application grows, organizing code by features rather than technical roles can improve maintainability:

```
/src
  /features
    /auth
      /components      - Auth-specific components
      /hooks           - Auth-related hooks
      /api             - Auth API integration
      /types           - Auth type definitions
    /dashboard
      /components      - Dashboard-specific components
      /hooks           - Dashboard-related hooks
      /api             - Dashboard API integration
      /types           - Dashboard type definitions
    /[other-features]
  /shared
    /components        - Shared components used across features
    /hooks             - Shared hooks
    /utils             - Utility functions
    /types             - Shared type definitions
  /lib                 - Third-party library configurations
  /config              - Application configuration
  /styles              - Global styles and theme configuration
  /assets              - Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
```

### 2. Improved Component Organization

The UI component directory contains many components directly at the root level. Consider organizing by component type or purpose:

```
/src/components
  /data-display        - Tables, Charts, Cards, etc.
  /inputs              - Form elements, Buttons, etc.
  /feedback            - Alerts, Progress, Toast, etc.
  /navigation          - Menu, Tabs, Sidebar, etc.
  /layout              - Grid, Container, etc.
  /overlay             - Modal, Drawer, Dialog, etc.
```

### 3. Add Context Directory

For managing global state with React Context:

```
/src/context
  /theme-context.tsx
  /auth-context.tsx
  /[other-contexts].tsx
```

### 4. API Layer Organization

Create a dedicated API layer:

```
/src/api
  /clients            - API client configurations
  /endpoints          - API endpoint definitions
  /hooks              - Custom hooks for API calls
  /types              - API response and request types
  /utils              - API-related utilities
```

### 5. Constants and Configuration

Extract constants and configuration:

```
/src/constants        - Application constants
/src/config           - Environment-specific configuration
```

### 6. Type Definitions

Centralize TypeScript type definitions:

```
/src/types            - Shared TypeScript interfaces and types
```

## Implementation Approach

To implement these changes without disrupting the current development workflow:

1. **Incremental Migration**: Move files gradually by feature rather than all at once
2. **Update Imports**: Use path aliases to minimize the impact of moving files
3. **Documentation**: Update the project documentation to reflect the new structure
4. **Team Communication**: Ensure all team members understand the new organization

## Benefits of Restructuring

- **Improved Discoverability**: Easier to locate code related to specific features
- **Enhanced Modularity**: Clear boundaries between different parts of the application
- **Better Scalability**: Structure accommodates growth without becoming unwieldy
- **Simplified Onboarding**: New team members can more easily understand the project

## Conclusion

The current structure is workable for a small to medium-sized application, but implementing the recommended changes will position the project better for future growth. Consider adopting these changes gradually as the application evolves.
